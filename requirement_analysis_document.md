# Requirement Analysis Document

## Objective
Build a CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard to monitor executions from GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins with realâ€‘time metrics, logs, and alerting.

## Functional Requirements
1. Data Collection: poll builds/pipelines from GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins; track provider, repo/job, build ID, status, start/end time, duration, URL.
2. Metrics & Visualization: success/failure rate, average build time, last build status; recent builds table; detail & logs.
3. Alerts: Slack and Email alerts on failures or successes with deduplication on state change.
4. APIs: REST for metrics/builds/logs; WebSocket for live updates.
5. Config: providers & repos/jobs via env or admin API.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Reliability: idempotent collectors, safe retries.
- Performance: configurable poll; DB indices.
- Security: secrets via env; CORS restricted.
- Observability: structured logs.
- Portability: Dockerized.
- Extensibility: pluggable collectors.

## Assumptions
- Read-only tokens provided by operator.
- Polling first; webhooks later.
- Postgres for relational/time-series queries.
- Logs fetched on-demand, not permanently stored initially.
